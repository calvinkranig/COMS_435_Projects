2^64 is longer than any long how can we store these large values?
How do we add old values to new bitset in dynamic?

Bitshift vs just adding 1

How many strings do I need to test for the derivation from the false positives to be less than 1%

how many bits are each character in this example?
how are you supposed to do 4, 8, 10
bits per element is something I choose
Are strings just 0's and 1's?

Aplication 1:
What will the constructor look like?
How are keys stored in grams.txt?
1 key per line 
Gives you total number of keys so size of bloom filter

Do i get to save the names of the text files
Do i need to check gram.txt to make sure the key is valid
	-if so can i use a hashset

each key is the first 4 words in the line
why do you allow a hash table for naive differential?

Aplication 2:
When you say tabular does that mean the entries are in the form
a1 a2
a1 a2 



Dont use hashcode in FNV
Bits per element is something I choose
